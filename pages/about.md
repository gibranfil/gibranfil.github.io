# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
As a graduate of Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, I have a fondness for machine learning and AI, I have been working in image classification and image segmentation as a key point in my thesis. Aside from that I also have learned skills in other data science-related fields such as data wrangling, EDA, and data analysis. Aside from that I also work as Lab assistant Volunteer in a small village and co-founded a small university startup company.
